# laser-engraver

I wanted a laser engraver. I also wanted to learn how all the pieces go
together, and how to drive such a thing. This is the collection of 3D objects,
    scripts, CAD designs, etc needed to create one of these things.

## TODO

    [] Complete set of STL and CAD files for driving blocks
    [] Complete set of driving scripts
    [] Instructions for setting up a Pi to use the scripts
    [] Parts list for electro-mechanical components
