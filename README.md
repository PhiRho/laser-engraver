# laser-engraver

I wanted a laser engraver. I also wanted to learn how all the pieces go
together, and how to drive such a thing. This is the collection of 3D objects,
    scripts, CAD designs, etc needed to create one of these things.

## TODO

[x] Complete set of STL and CAD files for driving blocks

[x] Complete set of driving scripts

[x] Instructions for setting up a Pi to use the scripts

[x] Parts list for electro-mechanical components

[ ] Full tutorial (coming soon)

### Future Work
- Fix up some of the 3D designs
- Add turtle integration
- Build a UI?
- Dust/smoke extraction
